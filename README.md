# IC Mod Hub
 Mods for the game Idle Champions

## How to use:
Download [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)

[How to install](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_mono.html)

Mods (the dll files, not the source files) go in the `...\IdleChampions\BepInEx\plugins` folder.

Antivirus may flag these as a false positive for malware or trojan. This is why the source code and the project files are included. If you don't feel comfortable downloading a dll from an untrusted source, which you shouldn't and this is, you can build the mod yourself in VS.
