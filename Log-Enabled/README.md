The console log is disabled shortly after game load. This mod reenables it. The console window still needs to be enabled in the BepInEx config file. Instructions are in it.

This is used for debugging game and mod code. It can be used if you are having issues with a mod loading and you know what you are looking for. Every mod has a loading log. More complex mods have logging throughout.
